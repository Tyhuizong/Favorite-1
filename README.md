# Hobbies-
My favorite activities

## Video Games
I almost always play video games 3x a week and has been one of my biggest hobbies for 15 years. I love to play multiplayer games and really its to connect with friends. Games can range from FPS to MMOs, but surprisingly I dont enjoy Single player games.
1. Honestly the best way to connect with friends that have moved away from home
2. Has made me want to improve my computer which in turn has made me learn more about hardware and software
3. I get good laughs with my buddies
