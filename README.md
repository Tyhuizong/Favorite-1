# **Hobbies**
My favorite activities

## Video Games
I almost always play video games 3x a week and has been one of my biggest hobbies for 15 years. I love to play multiplayer games and really, it’s to connect with friends. Games can range from FPS to MMOs, but surprisingly I don’t enjoy Single player games.
### Why i enjoy video games:
1. Honestly the best way to connect with friends that have moved away from home
2. Has made me want to improve my computer which in turn has made me learn more about hardware and software
3. I get good laughs with my buddies

## Paddle Boarding (summer)
We love summer camping trips with my fiancé, our two dogs, Luna (Golden) and Alani (Husky). Luna adores water, but Alani absolutely hates it. Our favorite spots are Lake Chelan or Deception Pass because we enjoy hiking and paddle boarding. Paddle boarding has been our tradition since high school, even before we started dating.

### Why I enjoy paddle boarding:
1. I have always enjoyed any activity in the water
2. Its very relaxing, and half the time I sneak in a little nap 
3. My golden loves it and there is nothing like watching your older dog run and jump around like a puppy
